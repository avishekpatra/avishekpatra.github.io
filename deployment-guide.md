## 🚀 **Deployment Methods**

### **Method 1: Direct Upload (Easiest)**

1. **Download the deployment files** from this chat (I'll provide a package below)
2. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/avishekpatra/avishekpatra.github.io
3. **Delete existing files** (like README.md)
4. **Upload all files** maintaining the folder structure
5. **Enable GitHub Pages** in Settings → Pages → Source: "Deploy from a branch" → Branch: "main"

### **Method 2: Use GitHub Actions (Automated)**

Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: Deploy Portfolio

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup Node.js
